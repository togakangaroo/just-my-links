    "# AWS SSO Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook guides you through setting up AWS SSO for easier admin CLI access. When done, you will be able to log into your AWS account from the cli with something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "export AWS_PROFILE=just-my-links\n",
    "aws sso login\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While not necessary to do it this way, it makes it easier to use AWS from your CLI. You do need CLI access to AWS if you are going to be running Terraform locally (which is very helpful for development).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is *only a good idea* for the admin account you use to inspect and interact with AWS in the course of ops duties. You do not want to (and in fact can't) use this process for CI/CD.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this you first need to\n",
    "\n",
    "- Have or create an AWS account (you will need to supply a payment method though the expectation is that usage will be low enough to not get billed.)\n",
    "- Log into your AWS account via the UI.\n",
    "  - Ideally as part of account creation you created a superuser non-root account that you are using. Avoid using the root user whenever possible!\n",
    "- Navigate to *IAM Identity Center* and click *Enable*"
